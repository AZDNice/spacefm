<big><b><a href="#0.8.4">0.8.4 released</a></b></big><br>
2012-Dec-21

<p>SpaceFM 0.8.4, mostly a maintainance release, includes the following changes:

<ul>
    <li><b>dbus and libdbus runtime dependencies</b> in SpaceFM have been changed to optional in the README and provided debian packages.  While most users will have dbus installed already, SpaceFM should also be usable on systems without it.  If you do notice functional changes without dbus, please report them so they can be documented.  Note that the HAL build of SpaceFM still has build and runtime dependency on dbus, libdbus, and libdbus-glib.  See <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/next/README">README</a> for updated details.<br><br>
    <li>A bug introduced in 0.8.3 which caused a double-click on a folder in double-click mode to register a single click inside the new folder, losing history, has been corrected.<br><br>
    <li>A bug which caused some clicks in context menus to be lost when using some themes or mouse types has been corrected (actually a workaround was provided for the bug in gtk which caused this).<br><br>
    <li>A problem with SpaceFM Dialog commands sent to a command pipe too quickly has been corrected.<br><br>
    <li>A problem with icons not being aligned properly in some cases has been corrected.<br><br>
    <li>A socket task property popup_handler has been added to allow plugins to replace the default task popup dialog with a custom one.<br><br>
    <li>Socket task properties edit_file and run_in_terminal have been added to allow a plugin to open a file using the user's configured editor, and to run a command in the user's configured terminal.<br><br>
    <li>The NAME argument to internal SpaceFM Dialog commands 'show' and 'focus' is now optional to allow them to be used to present the dialog (bring the dialog to the top of other windows).<br><br>
    <li>SpaceFM Dialog element --viewer now accepts an optional [SAVEFILE] argument to save the contents of the viewer (particularly useful if the viewer is reading from a pipe).<br><br>
    <li>SpaceFM Dialog now sends stdout of external commands to /dev/null, to prevent the output being evaluated.<br><br>
    <li>The user's manual has been updated for the above changes.<br><br>
    <li>Some minor widget display issues with gtk3 beta build have been corrected.
</ul>

<big><b><a href="#0.8.3">0.8.3 released</a></b></big><br>
2012-Nov-24

<ul>
    <li>SpaceFM can now be built for <b>either GTK2 (the default) or GTK3 (beta test build)</b>.  Many thanks to BwackNinja for his continuing work on the GTK3 port and other areas of SpaceFM!  See the updated <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/master/README">README</a> file for GTK3 build instructions.<br><br>
    
    <b>IMPORTANT:  The GTK3 build is currently provided for testing purposes.</b>  SpaceFM runs very well in GTK3 with a functional theme, but many themes are broken due to <a href="http://igurublog.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/gnome-et-al-rotting-in-threes/">frequent breakage in GTK3's theme support</a>.  Thus it is very important to <b>use a GTK3 theme which is compatible</b> with your current version of GTK.  Run <code>spacefm</code> in a terminal to see any theme-related warnings.  When in doubt, compare behavior with the Adwaita default GNOME theme.  SpaceFM also recommends <a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Clearlooks-Phenix?content=145210">Clearlooks-Phenix</a> and <a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/DarkMint?content=150904">DarkMint</a> as generally well-maintained themes.<br><br>
    
    <b>Plugin authors</b> should note that their plugins may now be running on GTK3 as well as GTK2.  Most <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#dialog">SpaceFM Dialog</a> functions work comparably in GTK3, but there are minor differences.  If you encounter a major difference or breakage in SpaceFM Dialog on GTK3, please report it.<br><br>
    
    <li>SpaceFM 0.8.3 introduces the <b>new socket commands</b>, which allow custom commands and plugins to easily interact with the GUI.  For example, socket commands can be used to record or change the size of a SpaceFM window; show or hide panels or side panes; resize panels, panes, and columns; select files in a given window, panel, or tab; place text or files on the clipboard; read text or files from the clipboard; place text in a panel's status bar; update the progress bar and other information displayed about running tasks, and much more.  The user's manual has been updated with a new <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#sockets">Sockets</a> section.<br><br>
    
    <li>A <b>new Events submenu</b> has been added to the main menu bar's View menu.  This menu allows custom event handlers to be set.  This allows you to write command lines or scripts which are run when certain events occur in SpaceFM windows.  In some cases these handlers can replace the default behavior.  For example, you might make a custom response for middle-clicking on the path bar.  <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#sockets-menu">details</a><br><br>

    <li><b><a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#dialog">SpaceFM Dialog</a> features have been extended:</b><br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>You can now place custom text or no text (no percentage) on a <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#dialog-simple-progress">progress bar</a><br><br>
        <li>%(command) arguments in <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#dialog-cmd">commands</a> now accept a bash command line<br><br>
        <li><a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#dialog-simple-label">--label</a> elements now accept option --wrap or --nowrap to control whether text is wrapped.  If neither option is specified, the GTK2 default is to always wrap, and the GTK3 default is to wrap unless the label is packed into an <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#dialog-nonvis-hbox">--hbox</a> element.<br><br>
        <li>Option --compact or --expand may now be included for any element to force how the element is packed into the current box, overriding the default behavior.<br><br>
        <li>A <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#dialog-nonvis-winclose">--window-close</a> element has been added, which specifies a command to be run when the user attempts to close the window, allowing for an 'Are you sure?' message or other conditional closure.<br><br>
        <li>Option [REVERSE] has been added to the internal <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#dialog-int-close">close</a> command to optionally inhibit its function.
    </ul><br>
    
    <li>An <b>fm_edit function has been added</b> to the <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#exvar">exported bash variables</a> available for use in commands.  <code>fm_edit FILE</code> opens a file using the user's configured editor.<br><br>
    
    <li><b>configure option --disable-pixmaps</b> is now the default, meaning by default icons will be installed to share/icons/ rather than share/pixmaps/.  If you prefer the latter, add configure option --enable-pixmaps when building.  Since --disable-pixmaps is now the default, be sure to run these additional commands after <code>make install</code>:
    <pre>    sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -q -t -f /usr/<i>local/</i>share/icons/hicolor
    sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -q -t -f /usr/<i>local/</i>share/icons/Faenza</pre><br>
    
    <li>SpaceFM <b>command line option --version</b> has been added to display version and build information.  Plugins can use this option to test for a particular SpaceFM version.<br><br>
    
    <li><b>Ctrl+rubberband</b> (drag cursor) may now be used to add to a selection on the desktop<br><br>
    
    <li><b>Spacing of items in icon and compact view modes</b> has been reduced for more efficient use of space<br><br>
    
    <li><b>Thumnbails are now automatically oriented</b> based on EXIF data.<br><br>
    
    <li><b>A wallpaper zoom mode</b> has been added to View|Preferences|Desktop.<br><br>
    
    <li>A setting for <b>alternate display of file sizes using SI decimal</b> (1K = 1000 bytes) has been restored to View|Preferences|Interface.  This option, disabled by default, will cause all file and device sizes and copy speeds displayed in SpaceFM to be decimal rather than binary.  (Some file managers use this irregular method for measuring file sizes, so this option is provided for compatibility.)<br><br>

    <li>The <b>Rubberband Select option</b> formerly in View|Preferences|Interface has been moved to the file list's context menu in View|Style.  This option can be disabled only when view style is set to Detailed.<br><br>
    
    <li>A <b>secondary sort has been added</b> to icons on the desktop (applies to SpaceFM's Desktop Manager).  For example, when sorting icons by size, if two have the same size, they will be presented in alphabetical order based on their names.  This corrects a problem with the displayed order changing when the desktop is clicked.<br><br>
    
    <li>When using the CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM kernel config option, <b>multiple empty /dev/ramN entries</b> were shown in the Devices list when Show|Internal Drives was enabled.  These are now hidden by default if unmounted.  If you prefer they be displayed, you can add one or more to <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#devices-settings-vol">Show|Volumes</a>.<br><br>
    
    <li>The <b><a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-next-en.html#introduction-highlights">Highlights</a> and <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-next-en.html#introduction-history">History</a> sections</b> of the user's manual have been updated.<br><br>
    
    <li>Centering of icon labels has been corrected<br><br>
    
    <li>A problem introduced in 0.8.1-0.8.2 which made it impossible to click and drag a selection of multiple files in icon and compact view modes has been corrected<br><br>
    
    <li>A problem which caused make to fail on gtk 2.18 has been corrected<br><br>
    
    <li>SpaceFM's <b>Russian translation</b> has been updated - thanks to Vladimir Kudrya and new translator Vladimir Lomov<br><br>
    
    <li><b><a href="http://pibanglinux.org/">Pibang Linux</a> for the Raspberry Pi, built on the armhf architecture</b>, now includes SpaceFM, and SpaceFM may be selected as the default file manager during installation.

<big><b><a href="#newgtk3alpha">GTK3 Alpha Testing Moved To Next</a></b></big><br>
2012-Nov-02

<p>Alpha testing in the gtk3 branch of SpaceFM has been merged into the next branch.  This means gtk3 support is planned to be available in the next release as an optional beta test build.

<p>Because the gtk3 branch no longer exists, if you want to alpha test gtk3 before the next release, please use these instructions:

<p>1) Install spacefm build dependencies (see <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/next/README">README</a>), adding <b>libgtk-3-0</b> and <b>libgtk-3-bin</b>.

<p>2) Run these commands:
<pre>
    # Download &amp; Extract
    mkdir /tmp/spacefm-build &amp;&amp; cd /tmp/spacefm-build
    wget -O spacefm.tar.gz https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tarball/next
    tar xzf spacefm.tar.gz
    cd IgnorantGuru-spacefm-*

    # Build &amp; Install
    ./configure --with-gtk3
    make -s
    sudo make install
    sudo update-mime-database /usr/local/share/mime > /dev/null
    sudo update-desktop-database -q
    sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -q -t -f /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor
    sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -q -t -f /usr/local/share/icons/Faenza

    # Remove Temporary Files
    cd / &amp;&amp; rm -rf /tmp/spacefm-build
</pre>
    
<p>Or if using Arch Linux, you can install the gtk3 build using <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=63929">AUR spacefm-gtk3</a>.

<p><b>Be sure to use a gtk3 theme that is compatible</b> with your version of gtk3.  If spacefm is run in a terminal, you should see no theme warnings.  Beware - broken themes can cause malfunctions in the GUI, and <a href="http://igurublog.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/gnome-et-al-rotting-in-threes/">many gtk3 themes are broken</a>.  Also note that some themes will make spacefm run more slowly.  <a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Clearlooks-Phenix?content=145210">Clearlooks-Phenix</a> is a well-maintained theme for gtk 3.4 (although on some systems Clearlooks themes in general tend to run more slowly).  For a dark theme, <a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/DarkMint?content=150904">DarkMint</a> runs fast and is well-maintained for gtk 3.4.

<br><a name="0.8.2"></a>
<big><b><a href="#0.8.2">0.8.2 released and GTK3 Alpha Testing</a></b></big><br>
2012-Oct-25

<p>This maintenance release is primarily to correct problems building with hal.  0.8.2 corrects several issues present in 0.8.1:

<ul>
<li>Problems building with the --enable-hal configure option have been corrected.<br><br>
<li>The way information is displayed in the overwrite dialog and task popups has been modified.<br><br>
<li>An old bug which sometimes produced an erroneous 'destination is contained in source' error has been corrected.<br><br>
<li>An old bug which prevented cutting a directory and pasting it, overwriting a directory with the same name, has been corrected (#174)<br><br>
<li>The French and Russian translations have been updated
</ul>

<b>SpaceFM GTK3 Now Available For Alpha Testing</b><br>
BwackNinja's current work porting SpaceFM to GTK3 has gone through an initial review and has been added to the alpha test gtk3 branch of SpaceFM.  This branch can be built for either GTK2 (the default) or for GTK3 using configure option <b>--with-gtk3</b> (GTK3 will be used automatically if GTK2 is not installed).  Distros should not package this branch except for testing.

<p>When built with GTK2, this branch should run exactly like 0.8.2.  When built with GTK3, this branch may have some remaining GUI issues, but the file operations should not be affected.  The GTK3 build can use some thorough testing.

<p>To build from the gtk3 branch, please follow <del>the instructions in the gtk3 README</del> <a href="#newgtk3alpha">these updated instructions</a>.  When reporting issues, please be sure to specify your build method and branch.

<p>It's also possible to easily build a binary <b>debian package for spacefm-gtk3</b> - see the CREATE DEB PACKAGE section in the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/next/README">next README</a> (until the next release, you must change "master" to "next" in the wget command).  

<p>For Arch Linux, you can install the gtk3 build using <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=63929">AUR spacefm-gtk3</a>.

<p><b>Thanks for testing!</b>  The more feedback we receive on GTK3, the faster it can evolve and move toward inclusion in the stable release version.

<br><a name="0.8.1"></a>
<big><b><a href="#0.8.1">0.8.1 released</a></b></big><br>
2012-Oct-21

<p><b>UPDATE 2012-10-23:</b>:  The deprecated hal build (configure --enable-hal) is broken in 0.8.1 (and prior).  Until 0.8.2 is released, hal users can use <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tarball/069be5e37ccc32fb8f1fe06649d667793421b463">this modified tarball</a> to correct the hal issues in 0.8.1.  spacefm-hal in the PPA has been temporarily reverted to 0.7.5.  Although hal support is deprecated (no longer actively developed), all SpaceFM releases should still build with hal, so users should continue to report issues if it doesn't.

<p>Changes in 0.8.1:
<ul>
<li>SpaceFM 0.8.1 includes a <b>new task manager queue</b> designed to improve performance.  Some tasks on the same drives will no longer run simultaneously, and you can manually pause, resume, and queue tasks, including custom commands.  The task manager, including the new queueing abilities, is now fully documented in the <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#tasks">User's Manual - Tasks section</a>.  This is recommended reading so you can get the most out of the new features.  For example, did you know that <b>you can now simply left-click on the Status column</b> to pause, resume, or queue a task?  It's also possible to disable queuing of new tasks, which means SpaceFM will work like before, unless you manually queue a task.<br><br>

<li>SpaceFM now <b>builds on older versions of GTK2 down to 2.18, including Debian stable ("squeeze")</b>.  Thanks to BwackNinja, a new contributor to SpaceFM, who completed most of this portability work as part of his preparation for porting SpaceFM to gtk3, which is well under way (see below).  In addition, SpaceFM no longer has a hard dependency on libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 (because in earlier versions of gtk, this is not a separate library).  Also, <b>libstartup-notification is now optional</b>.  When building SpaceFM, if it is present it will be used; if not, ignored.  You can also include the configure option --disable-startup-notification to force a build without it even if installed.<br><br>

<li>SpaceFM's overwrite query dialog (the one that asks you if you want to rename or overwrite a file) has been redesigned, with more space for long filenames and an auto-rename feature.  You can also now resize the dialog and the size will be remembered.<br><br>

<li>The task popup dialogs can now show optional <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#tasks-dlg">overwrite and error controls</a>.  This means you can queue tasks and set them to overwrite all or auto rename without waiting for the query dialog.  Error handling may now be set on a per task basis.<br><br>

<li>A precision timer has been added to provide more smooth and accurate copy speeds in the task manager.<br><br>

<li>A problem detecting mounted btrfs partitions has been corrected in SpaceFM 0.8.1 and <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/udevil/news.html#0.3.4">udevil 0.3.4</a>.<br><br>

<li>Russian and French translations have been updated, and thanks to tct1501 for a new partial Dutch translation.<br><br>

<li>The <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/plugins">SpaceFM Wiki</a> has some <b>new plugins</b>, including a few by Keith that use the new <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#dialog">SpaceFM Dialog</a>.<br><br>

<li><a href="http://slackbuilds.org/system/spacefm/">spacefm</a> and <a href="http://slackbuilds.org/system/udevil/">udevil</a> are now included at <b>SlackBuilds.org</b><br><br>

<li>A <b>new custom distro</b> <a href="http://webpath.net/node/127">Spaceman</a> has been created by Todd Robinson.  This is a Lubuntu 12.04 release with all updates applied, and SpaceFM installed as the default file manager.<br><br>
</ul>

<b>What's Ahead?</b><br>
A port of SpaceFM to <b>GTK version 3 has been started</b> by BwackNinja.  Rather than simply requiring gtk3, the plan is to make SpaceFM buildable with either gtk2 or gtk3 via a configure switch.  Thus support for gtk2 is planned to continue for some time, even after the port is complete.  If you're really eager to try gtk3, BwackNinja has an <a href="https://github.com/BwackNinja/spacefm/commits/next">under-development gtk3 fork at github</a>.  He reports it does build with gtk3 but still has some minor issues to be addressed.  In the coming weeks, as this code matures, it will be reviewed, tested and merged into SpaceFM's gtk3 branch for beta testing, and from there into the next branch.  Thanks to BwackNinja for contributing this port!

    <li><b>Pattern Mode:</b>  If the search key contains at least one asterisk (*) or question mark (?), a glob substring search is now used. (An asterisk is automatically added before and after your key before testing.)  For pattern usage see <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_13_01">IEEE Pattern Matching Notation</a>.<br><br>

    <li><b>Non-Pattern Mode:</b>  If your key does not contain an asterisk (*) or question mark (?), a normal substring search is performed, with the following new special characters recognized:<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>If the search key begins with a caret (^), the search will match names <i>beginning</i> with your key.  
        <li>If your key ends with a dollar sign ($), the search will match names <i>ending</i> with your key.
        <li>You can use both a caret and dollar sign to constrain both.  (Other regex characters and wildcards are not supported in this mode.)
    </ul><br>
    <li>As before, anytime you use an uppercase letter anywhere in your search key, the search mode becomes <b>case sensitive</b>.<br><br>

    <li>As before, regardless of mode, you can press down or up arrow, or scroll wheel up/down, to go to the <b>next or previous matched filename</b>.<br><br>
</ul>

<p><b>In addition, SpaceFM 0.7.11 includes the following changes:</b>

<ul>
    <li>A new custom command style <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#designmode-style-confirm">Confirmation</a> has been added to the Design Mode menu.<br><br>
    <li>A new command line option <b>--no-saved-tabs, -n</b> has been added which causes SpaceFM to not load saved tabs when opening a new window, even if File|Saved Tabs was used in the last saved session.  This allows you to open an additional window containing only a single folder, for example.<br><br>
    <li>Command line option <b>--reuse-tab</b> can now be used in conjunction with other options<br><br>
    <li>Specifying command line option <b>--panel=N</b> without a folder path now shows and focuses panel N<br><br>
    <li>The user's manual <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#invocation-windows">Invocation</a> section has been updated with <b>additional command line usage examples</b>.<br><br>
    <li><b>Network URLs can now be specified on the command line</b> same as folder paths.  This means SpaceFM can now be set as a handler for a given protocol, eg in spacefm.desktop you can set:
    <blockquote>MimeType=inode/directory;inode/mount-point;x-scheme-handler/ssh;x-scheme-handler/smb;x-scheme-handler/nfs;x-scheme-handler/ftp;</blockquote><br>
    <li>Edit|<b>Select By Pattern</b> has been added to the file list's context menu to <b>select files by glob</b>.  This function can also be accessed using a <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#gui-pathbar-pattern">percent prefix</a> in the Path Bar.<br><br>
    <li>A <b>custom <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#gui-pathbar-protohand">Protocol Handler</a></b> may now be configured, allowing custom scripts or programs to be used to open URLs, and allowing custom protocols to be added.<br><br>
    <li>When no files are selected, the <b>status bar now displays the current directory</b>.  If the canonicalized path differs, the <b>status bar shows the canonical path</b>.  (The canonical or 'real' path is determined by recursively following all links in the path.)<br><br>
    <li><b>Go|Real Path has been added</b> to the file list's context menu.  If no files are selected, this will cause SpaceFM to change to the canonical path of the current directory.  If files are selected, the <i>first</i> selected file's path will be canonicalized, and SpaceFM will change to the canonical directory and select the file.  So, for example, selecting a link and selecting Go|Real Path will take you to the real file target, regardless of the number of compounded links in the path.<br><br>
    <li>File|Root Window now opens the current folder.<br><br>
    <li><b>libgtk2.0-bin</b> has been added as a SpaceFM dependency when using build option --disable-pixmaps (recommended).  The provided deb packages now include this dependency.<br><br>
    <li>SpaceFM's <b>overwrite query dialog now shows file times and sizes</b> for comparing the source file to the file you are overwriting<br><br>
    <li>SpaceFM now automatically runs '<b>udevil clean</b>' if it detects another process unmounting a device, in order to remove any udevil-created mount point.  This is only run if udevil is the default Mount Command or Unmount Command.<br><br>
    <li><b>Automatic unmounting of ejected media has been corrected</b> - be sure to update to <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/udevil/news.html#0.3.2">udevil 0.3.2</a><br><br>
    <li><b>File change detection</b> is now done on all filesystems <i>except</i> on non-block devices which are type nfs fuse cifs smbfs or ftpfs.  If you encounter an additional filesystem type for which you believe change detection should be disabled (for example a network filesystem which causes GUI hangs while copying) please <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues">report the issue</a>.<br><br>
    <li>Pressing F1 (default help key) while the Path Bar or Devices list are focused will now open the manual to the appropriate section.<br><br>
    <li>A <b>problem with target selection when dragging and dropping</b> in Icon view mode which caused SpaceFM to drop the files into the wrong folder has been corrected<br><br>
    <li>Vladimir Kudrya's <b>Russian translation has been updated</b>.<br><br>
</ul>

2012-Jul-25

<p><b>Thanks to Vladimir Kudrya for a complete Russian translation</b> of SpaceFM (and udevil 0.3.1).

<p>SpaceFM's icon designer, <b>Goran Simovic, has provided new SpaceFM icons for the Faenza theme</b> (see locations below).
    
<p><b>New sort options</b> have been added to allow a natural sort and a case senstive sort.  Also, folders in the file list may now be places after files, or mixed with files.  Hidden files may now be placed after regular files.  Right-click on the file list and select View|Style|Sort to adjust these new options.  Natural sort is now the new default.

<p>The status bar and running tasks now show one decimal place for GB and TB sizes under 10.

<p>A new configure option <b>--disable-pixmaps</b> has been added.  Although it is not the default, it is recommended for packagers and users to build with this option, which causes SpaceFM's icons to be installed to the newer /usr/share/icons/hicolor rather than /usr/share/pixmaps.  This enables GTK's icon cache for these icons.  Also, the Faenza icons will be installed to /usr/share/icons/Faenza with this option.  When building with --disable-pixmaps, <b>after install be sure to run</b>:
<pre>    sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -q -t -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor
    sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -q -t -f /usr/share/icons/Faenza</pre>

Otherwise the icons may not be found.  The provided deb packages, the self-extracting installer, and Arch AUR spacefm-git now build with --disable-pixmaps and run gtk-update-icon-cache automatically.  [<b>UPDATE</b>: Requires <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues/130">libgtk2.0-bin</a>]

<p>A problem introduced in SpaceFM 0.7.9 which caused file changes to not be detected on <b>aufs and devtmpfs</b> filesystems has been corrected.

<p>A problem where the Skip All function in the file overwrite query behaved like Cancel has been corrected.

<p>A reported problem building SpaceFM on Slackware should now be corrected.

<p><b>SpaceFM is now included in the <a href="http://sysresccd.org/">SystemRescueCD</a> live distro.</b>

<p><b>trile7's Trash Plugin</b>, available on the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/plugins/">wiki</a>, now supports multiple devices and partitions.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br><hr><a name="0.7.9"></a>
<big><b><a href="#0.7.9">0.7.9 released</a></b></big><br>
2012-Jul-13

<p><b>New in SpaceFM 0.7.9:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Parts of SpaceFM's <b>GUI and multi-threaded VFS</b> have been redesigned to allow tasks (such as Copy, Move, or custom commands) to run better.  This improves performance with network filesystems (eg nfs), reduces lag in the GUI during file operations, reduces CPU load during copying and other tasks, eliminates rare crashes caused by thread race conditions, and allows the run dialog to handle fast/flooded output on stdout and stderr.
    <br><b>TIP:</b>  When copying large files TO a network filesystem, avoid working in the remote directory tab until the copy is complete to avoid GUI lag issues.  (See <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues/107">development details</a> on the new threading design)<br><br>
    <li><b>File changes are no longer detected in filesystems on non-block devices</b> (except tmpfs and ramfs).  This avoids blocking the GUI with network filesystems as copies are in progress, but also means you may need to manually refresh to see the updated file sizes.  (If you encounter a filesystem that you think needs a file change monitoring exception, please report it.)<br><br>
    <li>As in prior versions, before starting a copy or other task, SpaceFM will recursively calculate the total size of selected files.  As of version 0.7.9, this <b>calculation will time out</b> after 5 seconds, to avoid long delays when using a network filesystem.<br><br>
    <li>To improve performance, the total <b>size of files being deleted is no longer calculated</b> in advance.  This means that a delete dialog will no longer contain a 'time remaining' estimate.  (Due to filesystem particulars, such estimates were not very accurate anyway.)<br><br>
    <li>A minor <b>bug where SpaceFM failed to close a file</b> being copied when the copy was aborted or an error occured has been corrected.  This bug caused some files to remain open until SpaceFM was closed, which sometimes interfered with unmounting.<br><br>
    <li>A bug which caused SpaceFM to fail to <b>report an error when copying an inaccessable subdirectory</b> has been corrected.  (Note that this bug dates all the way back to VFS code from legacy PCManFM, which means this bug is also present in PCManFM-Mod.)<br><br>
    <li>A deadlock (hang caused by multiple threads) which occured on a <b>quick directory change</b> while a large directory was being loaded has been corrected.<br><br>
    <li>Tomas Forsman (<a href="http://www.foresightlinux.se/wiki-en/index.php?title=User:TForsman">TForsman</a>), developer of <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/">Foresight Linux</a>, has contributed a <b>Swedish translation</b> for SpaceFM which is approximately 40% complete.  TForsman's suggestion for translators to use the 'poedit' program has been added to the TRANSLATE instructions file.<br><br>
    <li><a href="http://www.jpfleury.net/en/">jpfleury</a> has updated SpaceFM's (complete) <b>French translation</b> for 0.7.9.<br><br>
    <li>The <b>'Path' column in the task manager has been renamed 'Folder'</b>.<br><br>
    <li>The Folder, Item, and To columns in the task manager are now <b>ellipsized</b>.<br><br>
    <li>The <b>Root submenu of the devices menu is now enabled</b> even if no device is selected.<br><br>
    <li>The <b>rename and new file/folder dialogs now apply custom fonts</b> to all entries<br><br>
    <li>Due to the improved handling of flooded output, SpaceFM now <b>runs tar verbose</b> for archive extraction and creation<br><br>
    <li>A problem with use of the <b>urxvtc terminal</b> program has been corrected.  Note that like lxterminal and konsole, urxvtc will not run correctly with both Run As Task and Run In Terminal checked (due to the lack of a separate instance option in these terminals).<br><br>
    <li>Clicking on a device now shows any mount error<br><br>
    <li>The <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#designmode-mime-mimeworks">How MIME Works</a> section of the user's manual has been updated and corrected with regard to <b>update-desktop-database</b>.  SpaceFM also now runs update-desktop-database automatically (in addtion to update-mime-database) if you use the MIME menu to make changes externally.<br><br>    
    <li><b>udevil is now included with SpaceFM as the default file manager/mount solution for <a href="http://partedmagic.com/doku.php?id=news">Parted Magic</a></b>.<br><br>
    <li><b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/antix-linux/">antiX-12</a> will include SpaceFM with udevil in its default installation</b> (currently available in antiX testing).<br><br>
</ul>

<br><hr><a name="0.7.8"></a>
<big><b><a href="#0.7.8">0.7.8 released</a></b></big><br>
2012-Jun-16

<p><b>New in SpaceFM 0.7.8:</b>
<ul>
<li>Thanks to <a href="http://www.jpfleury.net/en/">jpfleury</a>, a <b>new and complete french translation</b> is now included for SpaceFM.  Note that due to design mode, your configuration overrides the language file for menu item names.  To see the newly translated menu item names, you must start with a fresh configuration (no session file).  Other internal strings, such as dialogs, will appear translated regardless of your configuration.<br><br>
<li>Design mode can now be used in the Open context menu on application names to open <b>the new <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#designmode-mime">MIME Menu</a></b>, which provides a way to easily add and remove application associations, and edit and view relevant MIME files (.desktop, XML MIME file type definition files, etc).  SpaceFM now uses and modifies your mimeapps.list file rather than the old defaults.list.  The new <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#designmode-mime-mimeworks">How MIME Works</a> section of the manual explains the details.<br><br>
<li>SpaceFM <b>now accepts ftp://, nfs://, smb://, and ssh:// URLs</b> in the path bar (for formatting, see <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/udevil/udevil--help.html">udevil --help</a>.  Requires <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/udevil/">udevil</a> and the appropriate network filesystem support (eg curlftpfs, cifs-utils, etc).  [Note:  SpaceFM has some unresolved performance issues with network filesystems - until these are addressed you may find it lags or becomes temporarily unresponsive when the network is busy copying, etc.]<br><br>
<li>The Open context menu now includes a <b>'Mount ISO' menu item</b> to automatically mount ISO files (requires udevil).  This menu item appears in the Open submenu when you right-click on an ISO file.  The Open|<b>Auto-Mount ISO</b> option can also be checked so SpaceFM will automatically mount and open an ISO file when you click on it.<br><br>
<li><b>The Devices list now shows mounted networks and mounted ISO files</b> (loop devices) if the new options Show|Mounted Networks and Show|Mounted Files are checked in Settings, and can be used to unmount these (unmounting requires udevil).<br><br>
<li>Mounted <b>networks can now be bookmarked</b> from the Devices List, or by editing a bookmark.<br><br>
<li>The new menu item '<b>Edit udevil.conf</b>' has been added to the Devices list context Root submenu.<br><br>
<li>SpaceFM now <b>automatically unmounts removed devices</b>.  For example, if you remove a usb stick without first unmounting it, SpaceFM will attempt to unmount it for you.<br><br>
<li><b>Creating a new file, folder, or manual link</b> in SpaceFM now uses a modified version of the rename dialog, providing more space for entering filenames.  This also adds the ability to create in other paths, create as root, create relative links, and <b>create new files and folders using templates</b>.  SpaceFM now looks in $XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR/, ~/Templates/, or ~/.templates/ to find template files.  Templates are simply empty or partially filled files used to create new files (of any type), so instead of an empty file you get a copy of the template file.  Any files or links to files may be placed in your Templates folder.  Subdirectories in the templates folder can also be used to create new folders pre-filled with a set of files, or to organize templates.<br><br>
<li>A [Create] <b>& Open button</b> has been added to the new file/folder dialog to create a new file or folder and open it in one step.<br><br>
<li>The new <b>xfce4 'terminal'</b> is now supported.<br><br>
<li>A new <b>-r, --reuse-tab <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#invocation-commandline">command line</a> option</b> has been added to open a folder in the current tab of an already open SpaceFM window, instead of creating a new tab.  This can also be used on initial startup to prevent SpaceFM from creating a default tab.<br><br>
<li><b>Mouse buttons 8 and 9</b> can now be used to go back and forward in SpaceFM, in addition to buttons 4 and 5.<br><br>
<li>A number of <b>new and improved plugins</b> have been contributed to the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/plugins/">plugins wiki</a>
</ul>

2012-May-05

<p>SpaceFM has been added to the Arch Linux [community] repository (<a href="http://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/i686/spacefm/">i686</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/spacefm/">amd64</a>).  Thanks to Arch TU Bartłomiej Piotrowski for maintaining these packages.  The Arch AUR also still contains <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=58247">spacefm-git</a>, which provides the 'next' branch as a work in progress.

<p>Also, I received word from Patrick Verner that <a href="http://partedmagic.com/doku.php">Parted Magic</a> will soon be replacing PCManFM-Mod with SpaceFM as its default file manager - not sure if this has reached their test release yet, but it should be there fairly soon.

<big><b>0.7.6 released</b></big><br>
2012-Apr-19

<p>SpaceFM 0.7.6 is a maintenance release to fix a few issues with 0.7.5, especially media detection.  Also, file permissions now show the SUID and SGID bits, and also Linux file type (char device, block device, pipe, socket), like ls output.

<p>The <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#devices-kernpoll">recommendation to enable kernel polling</a> has been added to the user's manual and README.  This especially important for <b>media detection when udisks is not used</b>.

<p>Please note that the provided deb packages since version 0.7.5 require $TMPDIR (usually /tmp) to be mounted <b>without noexec</b> (these packages build from source in $TMPDIR).  Otherwise you may want to build a deb package from source per the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/master/README">README</a>.

<big><b>0.7.5 released</b></big><br>
2012-Apr-14

<p>Changes in SpaceFM 0.7.5:

<ul>
    <li><b>removes dependency on udisks</b> - Although SpaceFM has never had a strict udisks dependency, the device manager used udisks for device detection, information, and mounting.  As of v0.7.5, SpaceFM can now be used without udisks.  SpaceFM now uses udev directly for device detection and information.  For mounting devices as a non-root user, udisks v1, udisks v2, or pmount will be automatically detected and used, or you can <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#devices-settings-mcmd">specify a custom command</a>.  There is also a custom mount solution <a href="http://igurublog.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/spacefm-udev/">currently under development</a>.  These changes do not affect the hal build of SpaceFM.<br>
    <b>UPDATE:</b>  If you're testing SpaceFM without udisks installed, you may want to <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues/66">enable kernel polling</a> on your system.<br><br>

    <li>The built-in archive extraction methods may now be used in the desktop manager<br><br>

    <li>An option View|Preferences|Interface|Default Drag Action has been added which allows you to control what action is performed by default when dragging files.  When set to Automatic, the drag will move files to the same device, and copy files to a different device.  Or the option can be set to always Move, Copy, or Link.  Regardless of the default setting, you can always override it by holding down keys.  Hold down Ctrl to force a copy, Shift to force a move, or Ctrl+Shift to force a link.<br><br>

    <li>SpaceFM has undergone a code review to clear all compiler warnings in the entire project, which resulted in a few potential problems being corrected.<br><br>

    <li>If no user configuration exists, SpaceFM will now read a default config from <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#programfiles-etc-xdg">/etc/xdg/spacefm/</a>  This allows distros and admins to set a default configuration.<br><br>
    
    <li>SpaceFM is now the default file manager for the upcoming <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.se/wiki-en/index.php?title=Lxde">Foresight Lxde</a>, and Foresight includes spacefm in its repositories.<br><br>
    
    <li><b>kdesudo</b> is now supported.  Also, when configured for /usr/bin/kdesu, SpaceFM will now also look in the $(kde4-config --path libexec) directory for kdesu (as KDE4 may no longer install kdesu to the user's path).<br><br>
    
    <li>The side box containing Devices, Bookmarks, and Tree is now fixed-width, meaning its width will not change unless you drag the slider to change it.<br><br>
    
    <li>Although no major new sections have been added, the <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html">user's manual</a> has been updated to reflect changes in this version.<br><br>
    
    <li>Instructions for <b>translators</b> have been added to the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/master/README">README</a>.<br><br>

    <li>The provided <b>deb packages</b> in <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tree/master/packages">Downloads</a> (also in the <a href="http://igurublog.wordpress.com/downloads/ppa/">PPA</a>) now contain the source code and build automatically from source.  Although this requires additional build dependencies and takes a little longer, this will make the packages work more reliably on most Debian-based distros.  Or, you can build your own deb package using the easy instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/master/README">README</a> file.<br>
    <b>NOTE:</b>  The <a href="http://igurublog.wordpress.com/downloads/ppa/">location of IgnorantGuru's PPA</a> has changed.  Please update your sources.list to continue receiving updates:

<big><b>Debian Packages For 0.7.4 Rebuilt</b></big><br>
2012-Apr-09

<p>Due to changing libraries in Debian sid which are now out of sync with Ubuntu and other Debian variants, the SpaceFM packages for v0.7.4 <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues/11">don't always work correctly</a>.  Binary deb packages of SpaceFM will no longer be offered, but to make installing more convenient for Debian users, I have created deb packages that contain the source code and automatically build and install with your package manager.  This will ensure that SpaceFM is built for the specific libraries you have installed on your system.

<p>These packages are available for version 0.7.4 in the <a href="http://igurublog.wordpress.com/downloads/ppa/">new PPA on github</a>.  They should work with your package manager just like the old packages did, except they will take a little longer to install.  If you're not using the PPA, you can obtain them in the updated <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tree/master/packages">packages directory</a> (to save a file there, click on the filename, then click 'View Raw').  

<p>If you have already installed 0.7.4, you will need to first remove it, clear your package cache, then install the new package.  With apt-get this is done like this:
<pre>    apt-get remove spacefm
    apt-get clean
    apt-get update
    apt-get install spacefm</pre>

<p>If you don't want packages that install automatically from source, you can also build your own binary deb packages or build from source using instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/master/README">README</a>.  Also, you can submit a packaging request with your distro, asking them to include packages of SpaceFM in their repositories.

<big><b>SpaceFM &amp; Udev</b></big><br>
2012-Apr-06

<p>A <a href="http://igurublog.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/spacefm-udev/">blog post</a> on what's currently happening with SpaceFM with regard to udisks2 and other issues.

<p>A number of new SpaceFM plugins have recently been added to the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/plugins/">wiki</a>.  The latest addition is <a href="http://www.jpfleury.net/en/software/corbeille-spacefm.php">JP Fleury's Corbeille-SpaceFM</a>, a freedesktop-compliant trash plugin optimized for speed and large files, available in French and English.  He has some <a href="http://www.jpfleury.net/en/software/corbeille-spacefm.php">speed comparisons</a> there that look promising!

<p>This means there are now several trash plugins to choose from.  Some of the plugins are from Arch users, with some discussion in the <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=133657">SpaceFM Arch forum thread</a> (the later pages deal more with plugins).

<p>Also, a new official <b>SpaceFM IRC channel</b>:  <i>#spacefm on <a href="http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml">irc.freenode.net</a></i>.  This is more intended for general chat than for support, but we'll see what develops.  OmegaPhil is in charge there.

<big><b>0.7.3 released</b></big><br>
2012-Mar-29

<p>SpaceFM 0.7.3 adds some important features and bugfixes:
<ul>
	<li>The new SpaceFM icons by Goran Simovic are now included, plus alternates (/usr/share/pixmaps/spacefm*.png).  If you've set View|Window Icon to a custom icon, you may want to clear it and check out the new default icon.  There is also a new icon for File Search.
	<li>The user's manual is available in the updated Help menu (now installed to /usr/share/spacefm), and context-sensitive help has been added.  To receive help on a menu item, just right-click on it and select Help from the design menu.  [Because the user's manual is incomplete, not everything has help available.  The device manager menu is fully documented, as is the design menu.]  For help in the design menu, hover the mouse over an item and press F1.  Help also works for plugins and custom commands - it opens a README file for you to view or edit.
	<li>The mouse shortcuts for Design Mode have changed, and new keyboard shortcuts are now available.  The primary change is that now right-click exclusively opens the design menu (it is no longer optional in Preferences).  Other mouse combos have been added.  Also, design mode can now be used with only the keyboard.  For example, highlight any menu item and press F1 for help, or F2 to open the design menu.  <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#designmode-shortcuts">See all the new shortcuts</a> 
	<li>Some problems with copying plugins to other menus have been corrected.
	<li>xdg-su and gnomesu are now available in the graphical su programs list.
	<li>The default drag action has been changed from move to copy.  If you want to force move instead, hold down Shift.  Or hold down Ctrl and Shift to create a link.
	<li>The <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html">user's manual</a> has been updated to reflect changes in 0.7.3
	<li>Instructions have been added to the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/master/README">README</a> file for using gdb to provide a backtrace on crashes, which helps to get them fixed more quickly
</ul>

Also, there are now a number of <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/plugins/">plugins available</a> on the wiki, including a trash plugin that has reportedly been working well.<br>

<br>
