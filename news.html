2012-Jul-25

<p><b>Thanks to Vladimir Kudrya for a complete Russian translation</b> of SpaceFM (and udevil 0.3.1).

<p>SpaceFM's icon designer, <b>Goran Simovic, has provided new SpaceFM icons for the Faenza theme</b> (see locations below).
    
<p><b>New sort options</b> have been added to allow a natural sort and a case senstive sort.  Also, folders in the file list may now be places after files, or mixed with files.  Hidden files may now be placed after regular files.  Right-click on the file list and select View|Style|Sort to adjust these new options.  Natural sort is now the new default.

<p>The status bar and running tasks now show one decimal place for GB and TB sizes under 10.

<p>A new configure option <b>--disable-pixmaps</b> has been added.  Although it is not the default, it is recommended for packagers and users to build with this option, which causes SpaceFM's icons to be installed to the newer /usr/share/icons/hicolor rather than /usr/share/pixmaps.  This enables GTK's icon cache for these icons.  Also, the Faenza icons will be installed to /usr/share/icons/Faenza with this option.  When building with --disable-pixmaps, <b>after install be sure to run</b>:
<pre>    sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -q -t -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor
    sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -q -t -f /usr/share/icons/Faenza</pre>

Otherwise the icons may not be found.  The provided deb packages, the self-extracting installer, and Arch AUR spacefm-git now build with --disable-pixmaps and run gtk-update-icon-cache automatically.

<p>A problem introduced in SpaceFM 0.7.9 which caused file changes to not be detected on <b>aufs and devtmpfs</b> filesystems has been corrected.

<p>A problem where the Skip All function in the file overwrite query behaved like Cancel has been corrected.

<p>A reported problem building SpaceFM on Slackware should now be corrected.

<p><b>SpaceFM is now included in the <a href="http://sysresccd.org/">SystemRescueCD</a> live distro.</b>

<p><b>trile7's Trash Plugin</b>, available on the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/plugins/">wiki</a>, now supports multiple devices and partitions.
<br><br>

<br><hr><a name="0.7.9"></a>
<big><b><a href="#0.7.9">0.7.9 released</a></b></big><br>
2012-Jul-13

<p><b>New in SpaceFM 0.7.9:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Parts of SpaceFM's <b>GUI and multi-threaded VFS</b> have been redesigned to allow tasks (such as Copy, Move, or custom commands) to run better.  This improves performance with network filesystems (eg nfs), reduces lag in the GUI during file operations, reduces CPU load during copying and other tasks, eliminates rare crashes caused by thread race conditions, and allows the run dialog to handle fast/flooded output on stdout and stderr.
    <br><b>TIP:</b>  When copying large files TO a network filesystem, avoid working in the remote directory tab until the copy is complete to avoid GUI lag issues.  (See <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues/107">development details</a> on the new threading design)<br><br>
    <li><b>File changes are no longer detected in filesystems on non-block devices</b> (except tmpfs and ramfs).  This avoids blocking the GUI with network filesystems as copies are in progress, but also means you may need to manually refresh to see the updated file sizes.  (If you encounter a filesystem that you think needs a file change monitoring exception, please report it.)<br><br>
    <li>As in prior versions, before starting a copy or other task, SpaceFM will recursively calculate the total size of selected files.  As of version 0.7.9, this <b>calculation will time out</b> after 5 seconds, to avoid long delays when using a network filesystem.<br><br>
    <li>To improve performance, the total <b>size of files being deleted is no longer calculated</b> in advance.  This means that a delete dialog will no longer contain a 'time remaining' estimate.  (Due to filesystem particulars, such estimates were not very accurate anyway.)<br><br>
    <li>A minor <b>bug where SpaceFM failed to close a file</b> being copied when the copy was aborted or an error occured has been corrected.  This bug caused some files to remain open until SpaceFM was closed, which sometimes interfered with unmounting.<br><br>
    <li>A bug which caused SpaceFM to fail to <b>report an error when copying an inaccessable subdirectory</b> has been corrected.  (Note that this bug dates all the way back to VFS code from legacy PCManFM, which means this bug is also present in PCManFM-Mod.)<br><br>
    <li>A deadlock (hang caused by multiple threads) which occured on a <b>quick directory change</b> while a large directory was being loaded has been corrected.<br><br>
    <li>Tomas Forsman (<a href="http://www.foresightlinux.se/wiki-en/index.php?title=User:TForsman">TForsman</a>), developer of <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/">Foresight Linux</a>, has contributed a <b>Swedish translation</b> for SpaceFM which is approximately 40% complete.  TForsman's suggestion for translators to use the 'poedit' program has been added to the TRANSLATE instructions file.<br><br>
    <li><a href="http://www.jpfleury.net/en/">jpfleury</a> has updated SpaceFM's (complete) <b>French translation</b> for 0.7.9.<br><br>
    <li>The <b>'Path' column in the task manager has been renamed 'Folder'</b>.<br><br>
    <li>The Folder, Item, and To columns in the task manager are now <b>ellipsized</b>.<br><br>
    <li>The <b>Root submenu of the devices menu is now enabled</b> even if no device is selected.<br><br>
    <li>The <b>rename and new file/folder dialogs now apply custom fonts</b> to all entries<br><br>
    <li>Due to the improved handling of flooded output, SpaceFM now <b>runs tar verbose</b> for archive extraction and creation<br><br>
    <li>A problem with use of the <b>urxvtc terminal</b> program has been corrected.  Note that like lxterminal and konsole, urxvtc will not run correctly with both Run As Task and Run In Terminal checked (due to the lack of a separate instance option in these terminals).<br><br>
    <li>Clicking on a device now shows any mount error<br><br>
    <li>The <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#designmode-mime-mimeworks">How MIME Works</a> section of the user's manual has been updated and corrected with regard to <b>update-desktop-database</b>.  SpaceFM also now runs update-desktop-database automatically (in addtion to update-mime-database) if you use the MIME menu to make changes externally.<br><br>    
    <li><b>udevil is now included with SpaceFM as the default file manager/mount solution for <a href="http://partedmagic.com/doku.php?id=news">Parted Magic</a></b>.<br><br>
    <li><b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/antix-linux/">antiX-12</a> will include SpaceFM with udevil in its default installation</b> (currently available in antiX testing).<br><br>
</ul>

<br><hr><a name="0.7.8"></a>
<big><b><a href="#0.7.8">0.7.8 released</a></b></big><br>
2012-Jun-16

<p><b>New in SpaceFM 0.7.8:</b>
<ul>
<li>Thanks to <a href="http://www.jpfleury.net/en/">jpfleury</a>, a <b>new and complete french translation</b> is now included for SpaceFM.  Note that due to design mode, your configuration overrides the language file for menu item names.  To see the newly translated menu item names, you must start with a fresh configuration (no session file).  Other internal strings, such as dialogs, will appear translated regardless of your configuration.<br><br>
<li>Design mode can now be used in the Open context menu on application names to open <b>the new <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#designmode-mime">MIME Menu</a></b>, which provides a way to easily add and remove application associations, and edit and view relevant MIME files (.desktop, XML MIME file type definition files, etc).  SpaceFM now uses and modifies your mimeapps.list file rather than the old defaults.list.  The new <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#designmode-mime-mimeworks">How MIME Works</a> section of the manual explains the details.<br><br>
<li>SpaceFM <b>now accepts ftp://, nfs://, smb://, and ssh:// URLs</b> in the path bar (for formatting, see <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/udevil/udevil--help.html">udevil --help</a>.  Requires <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/udevil/">udevil</a> and the appropriate network filesystem support (eg curlftpfs, cifs-utils, etc).  [Note:  SpaceFM has some unresolved performance issues with network filesystems - until these are addressed you may find it lags or becomes temporarily unresponsive when the network is busy copying, etc.]<br><br>
<li>The Open context menu now includes a <b>'Mount ISO' menu item</b> to automatically mount ISO files (requires udevil).  This menu item appears in the Open submenu when you right-click on an ISO file.  The Open|<b>Auto-Mount ISO</b> option can also be checked so SpaceFM will automatically mount and open an ISO file when you click on it.<br><br>
<li><b>The Devices list now shows mounted networks and mounted ISO files</b> (loop devices) if the new options Show|Mounted Networks and Show|Mounted Files are checked in Settings, and can be used to unmount these (unmounting requires udevil).<br><br>
<li>Mounted <b>networks can now be bookmarked</b> from the Devices List, or by editing a bookmark.<br><br>
<li>The new menu item '<b>Edit udevil.conf</b>' has been added to the Devices list context Root submenu.<br><br>
<li>SpaceFM now <b>automatically unmounts removed devices</b>.  For example, if you remove a usb stick without first unmounting it, SpaceFM will attempt to unmount it for you.<br><br>
<li><b>Creating a new file, folder, or manual link</b> in SpaceFM now uses a modified version of the rename dialog, providing more space for entering filenames.  This also adds the ability to create in other paths, create as root, create relative links, and <b>create new files and folders using templates</b>.  SpaceFM now looks in $XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR/, ~/Templates/, or ~/.templates/ to find template files.  Templates are simply empty or partially filled files used to create new files (of any type), so instead of an empty file you get a copy of the template file.  Any files or links to files may be placed in your Templates folder.  Subdirectories in the templates folder can also be used to create new folders pre-filled with a set of files, or to organize templates.<br><br>
<li>A [Create] <b>& Open button</b> has been added to the new file/folder dialog to create a new file or folder and open it in one step.<br><br>
<li>The new <b>xfce4 'terminal'</b> is now supported.<br><br>
<li>A new <b>-r, --reuse-tab <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#invocation-commandline">command line</a> option</b> has been added to open a folder in the current tab of an already open SpaceFM window, instead of creating a new tab.  This can also be used on initial startup to prevent SpaceFM from creating a default tab.<br><br>
<li><b>Mouse buttons 8 and 9</b> can now be used to go back and forward in SpaceFM, in addition to buttons 4 and 5.<br><br>
<li>A number of <b>new and improved plugins</b> have been contributed to the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/plugins/">plugins wiki</a>
</ul>

<big><b>Added to Arch Linux [community] repo</b></big><br>
2012-May-05

<p>SpaceFM has been added to the Arch Linux [community] repository (<a href="http://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/i686/spacefm/">i686</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/spacefm/">amd64</a>).  Thanks to Arch TU Bartłomiej Piotrowski for maintaining these packages.  The Arch AUR also still contains <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=58247">spacefm-git</a>, which provides the 'next' branch as a work in progress.

<p>Also, I received word from Patrick Verner that <a href="http://partedmagic.com/doku.php">Parted Magic</a> will soon be replacing PCManFM-Mod with SpaceFM as its default file manager - not sure if this has reached their test release yet, but it should be there fairly soon.

<big><b>0.7.6 released</b></big><br>
2012-Apr-19

<p>SpaceFM 0.7.6 is a maintenance release to fix a few issues with 0.7.5, especially media detection.  Also, file permissions now show the SUID and SGID bits, and also Linux file type (char device, block device, pipe, socket), like ls output.

<p>The <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#devices-kernpoll">recommendation to enable kernel polling</a> has been added to the user's manual and README.  This especially important for <b>media detection when udisks is not used</b>.

<p>Please note that the provided deb packages since version 0.7.5 require $TMPDIR (usually /tmp) to be mounted <b>without noexec</b> (these packages build from source in $TMPDIR).  Otherwise you may want to build a deb package from source per the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/master/README">README</a>.

<br>
<br>
0.7.6 ChangeLog:
<ul>
    unmount on exit no longer default (affects new installs)<br>
    documented deb packages require $TMPDIR not be noexec closes #64<br>
    relax has media criteria fixes #68<br>
    hack for icon theme missing application-x-xz-compressed-tar fixes #55<br>
    added kernel polling recommendation to docs closes #66<br>
    desktop new tab present window fixes #16<br>
    file permissions show SUID and SGID bits<br>
    file permissions show char device, block device, pipe, socket<br>
    panel show inhibit tab creation on spec<br>
</ul>

<big><b>0.7.5 released</b></big><br>
2012-Apr-14

<p>Changes in SpaceFM 0.7.5:

<ul>
    <li><b>removes dependency on udisks</b> - Although SpaceFM has never had a strict udisks dependency, the device manager used udisks for device detection, information, and mounting.  As of v0.7.5, SpaceFM can now be used without udisks.  SpaceFM now uses udev directly for device detection and information.  For mounting devices as a non-root user, udisks v1, udisks v2, or pmount will be automatically detected and used, or you can <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#devices-settings-mcmd">specify a custom command</a>.  There is also a custom mount solution <a href="http://igurublog.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/spacefm-udev/">currently under development</a>.  These changes do not affect the hal build of SpaceFM.<br>
    <b>UPDATE:</b>  If you're testing SpaceFM without udisks installed, you may want to <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues/66">enable kernel polling</a> on your system.<br><br>

    <li>The built-in archive extraction methods may now be used in the desktop manager<br><br>

    <li>An option View|Preferences|Interface|Default Drag Action has been added which allows you to control what action is performed by default when dragging files.  When set to Automatic, the drag will move files to the same device, and copy files to a different device.  Or the option can be set to always Move, Copy, or Link.  Regardless of the default setting, you can always override it by holding down keys.  Hold down Ctrl to force a copy, Shift to force a move, or Ctrl+Shift to force a link.<br><br>

    <li>SpaceFM has undergone a code review to clear all compiler warnings in the entire project, which resulted in a few potential problems being corrected.<br><br>

    <li>If no user configuration exists, SpaceFM will now read a default config from <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#programfiles-etc-xdg">/etc/xdg/spacefm/</a>  This allows distros and admins to set a default configuration.<br><br>
    
    <li>SpaceFM is now the default file manager for the upcoming <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.se/wiki-en/index.php?title=Lxde">Foresight Lxde</a>, and Foresight includes spacefm in its repositories.<br><br>
    
    <li><b>kdesudo</b> is now supported.  Also, when configured for /usr/bin/kdesu, SpaceFM will now also look in the $(kde4-config --path libexec) directory for kdesu (as KDE4 may no longer install kdesu to the user's path).<br><br>
    
    <li>The side box containing Devices, Bookmarks, and Tree is now fixed-width, meaning its width will not change unless you drag the slider to change it.<br><br>
    
    <li>Although no major new sections have been added, the <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html">user's manual</a> has been updated to reflect changes in this version.<br><br>
    
    <li>Instructions for <b>translators</b> have been added to the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/master/README">README</a>.<br><br>

    <li>The provided <b>deb packages</b> in <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tree/master/packages">Downloads</a> (also in the <a href="http://igurublog.wordpress.com/downloads/ppa/">PPA</a>) now contain the source code and build automatically from source.  Although this requires additional build dependencies and takes a little longer, this will make the packages work more reliably on most Debian-based distros.  Or, you can build your own deb package using the easy instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/master/README">README</a> file.<br>
    <b>NOTE:</b>  The <a href="http://igurublog.wordpress.com/downloads/ppa/">location of IgnorantGuru's PPA</a> has changed.  Please update your sources.list to continue receiving updates:
    <pre>    deb http://ignorantguru.github.com/debian/ unstable main</pre>
    
    <li>A number of new user-contributed plugins have been added to the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/plugins/">wiki</a> since the last release<br><br>
    
    <li>A number of issues have been corrected as detailed below.<br><br>
</ul>

<ul>
    replaced udisks with libudev kernel support for device detection and info<br>
    udisks v1 & v2 now supported for mount/unmount as normal user<br>

<big><b>Debian Packages For 0.7.4 Rebuilt</b></big><br>
2012-Apr-09

<p>Due to changing libraries in Debian sid which are now out of sync with Ubuntu and other Debian variants, the SpaceFM packages for v0.7.4 <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues/11">don't always work correctly</a>.  Binary deb packages of SpaceFM will no longer be offered, but to make installing more convenient for Debian users, I have created deb packages that contain the source code and automatically build and install with your package manager.  This will ensure that SpaceFM is built for the specific libraries you have installed on your system.

<p>These packages are available for version 0.7.4 in the <a href="http://igurublog.wordpress.com/downloads/ppa/">new PPA on github</a>.  They should work with your package manager just like the old packages did, except they will take a little longer to install.  If you're not using the PPA, you can obtain them in the updated <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tree/master/packages">packages directory</a> (to save a file there, click on the filename, then click 'View Raw').  

<p>If you have already installed 0.7.4, you will need to first remove it, clear your package cache, then install the new package.  With apt-get this is done like this:
<pre>    apt-get remove spacefm
    apt-get clean
    apt-get update
    apt-get install spacefm</pre>

<p>If you don't want packages that install automatically from source, you can also build your own binary deb packages or build from source using instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/master/README">README</a>.  Also, you can submit a packaging request with your distro, asking them to include packages of SpaceFM in their repositories.

<big><b>SpaceFM &amp; Udev</b></big><br>
2012-Apr-06

<p>A <a href="http://igurublog.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/spacefm-udev/">blog post</a> on what's currently happening with SpaceFM with regard to udisks2 and other issues.

<p>A number of new SpaceFM plugins have recently been added to the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/plugins/">wiki</a>.  The latest addition is <a href="http://www.jpfleury.net/en/software/corbeille-spacefm.php">JP Fleury's Corbeille-SpaceFM</a>, a freedesktop-compliant trash plugin optimized for speed and large files, available in French and English.  He has some <a href="http://www.jpfleury.net/en/software/corbeille-spacefm.php">speed comparisons</a> there that look promising!

<p>This means there are now several trash plugins to choose from.  Some of the plugins are from Arch users, with some discussion in the <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=133657">SpaceFM Arch forum thread</a> (the later pages deal more with plugins).

<p>Also, a new official <b>SpaceFM IRC channel</b>:  <i>#spacefm on <a href="http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml">irc.freenode.net</a></i>.  This is more intended for general chat than for support, but we'll see what develops.  OmegaPhil is in charge there.

<big><b>0.7.3 released</b></big><br>
2012-Mar-29

<p>SpaceFM 0.7.3 adds some important features and bugfixes:
<ul>
	<li>The new SpaceFM icons by Goran Simovic are now included, plus alternates (/usr/share/pixmaps/spacefm*.png).  If you've set View|Window Icon to a custom icon, you may want to clear it and check out the new default icon.  There is also a new icon for File Search.
	<li>The user's manual is available in the updated Help menu (now installed to /usr/share/spacefm), and context-sensitive help has been added.  To receive help on a menu item, just right-click on it and select Help from the design menu.  [Because the user's manual is incomplete, not everything has help available.  The device manager menu is fully documented, as is the design menu.]  For help in the design menu, hover the mouse over an item and press F1.  Help also works for plugins and custom commands - it opens a README file for you to view or edit.
	<li>The mouse shortcuts for Design Mode have changed, and new keyboard shortcuts are now available.  The primary change is that now right-click exclusively opens the design menu (it is no longer optional in Preferences).  Other mouse combos have been added.  Also, design mode can now be used with only the keyboard.  For example, highlight any menu item and press F1 for help, or F2 to open the design menu.  <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#designmode-shortcuts">See all the new shortcuts</a> 
	<li>Some problems with copying plugins to other menus have been corrected.
	<li>xdg-su and gnomesu are now available in the graphical su programs list.
	<li>The default drag action has been changed from move to copy.  If you want to force move instead, hold down Shift.  Or hold down Ctrl and Shift to create a link.
	<li>The <a href="http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html">user's manual</a> has been updated to reflect changes in 0.7.3
	<li>Instructions have been added to the <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/blob/master/README">README</a> file for using gdb to provide a backtrace on crashes, which helps to get them fixed more quickly
</ul>

Also, there are now a number of <a href="https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/plugins/">plugins available</a> on the wiki, including a trash plugin that has reportedly been working well.<br>
