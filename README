DESCRIPTION:

    udisks-based device manager, customizable menu system, and bash integration.

INSTALLER:

    A self-extracting installer is available:
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/spacefm/files/

        For signatures and SHA256 sums see 
            http://spacefm.sourceforge.net/spacefm.SHA256.txt

    The installer MUST be run in a terminal.  It automatically builds and
    installs.  Run it like this:
    
        bash spacefm-x.x.x-installer.sh
        
    or to see options:
    
        bash spacefm-x.x.x-installer.sh --help

    The installer requires the build dependencies listed below.  If any
    dependencies are missing, examine the error, install missing packages,
    and try again.
       
    To reinstall or upgrade, just run the latest installer again.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

1)  Install required build dependencies (below are Debian package names - 
    packages names on your distro may vary but should be similar):

        autotools-dev dbus desktop-file-utils libc6 libcairo2 libdbus-1-3
        libglib2.0-0 libgtk2.0-0 libpango1.0-0 libstartup-notification0
        libx11-6 shared-mime-info intltool pkg-config libgtk2.0-dev
        libglib2.0-dev fakeroot libstartup-notification0-dev libdbus-1-dev
        libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0
 
    NOTE: libgtk must be >= 2.24.  Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu 10.04 users
        may not be able to install SpaceFM due to repositories missing package
        libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0

    Also Recommended: udisks ktsuss|gksu wget eject lsof

    IF building with HAL support, you also need:
        hal libhal-dev libhal-storage-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libhal-storage1
        libhal1 libdbus-glib-1-2

    IF disabling inotify support, you also need fam or gamin:
        fam|gamin libfam0|libgamin0 libfam-dev|libgamin-dev

    configure will report anything missing when you run it as shown below.
    
2)  Extract spacefm-x.x.x.tar.xz and enter directory.  The following commands
    will build and install as "/usr/local/bin/spacefm":
    
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime > /dev/null
        sudo update-desktop-database -q

    NOTE: If configure reports missing dependencies, install them and run
    configure again before proceeding to make.

    NOTE: If hal support is desired (this will disable udisks support and will
    seriously limit device manager capabilities), add --enable-hal to the
    configure command above.

    NOTE: If you don't want to use the inotify kernel support and instead
    want fam or gamin to detect directory changes, add to configure:
        --disable-inotify
        
    NOTE: SpaceFM supports ktsuss, gksu, gksudo, and kdesu.  To build with an
    additional custom su program ('/usr/bin/mysu' in this example), add:
        --with-preferable-sudo=/usr/bin/mysu  # to the configure command

    For general build information consult the INSTALL file.
