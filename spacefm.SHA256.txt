SpaceFM Authentication Instructions


  Each version of SpaceFM is distributed with a file named
  spacefm-x.x.x.SHA256.txt (where x.x.x is the current version number) which is
  used to authenticate distributed files.


Why Authenticate?

  Verifying the authenticity of downloaded files prior to installation is
  important to ensure that your download is not corrupt and that no one has
  tampered with the server holding the files.


1) If you don't already have IgnorantGuru's CURRENT key on your keyring:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 0x7977070A723C6CCB696C0B0227A5AC5A01937621
    (if you receive an error, try again)
    
  Also visually verify that the given fingerprint matches the one shown here:
    http://igurublog.wordpress.com/contact-ignorantguru/


2) Download one or more files (the first is required) (replace x.x.x with
   current version number):

  wget http://downloads.sf.net/project/spacefm/spacefm-x.x.x.SHA256.txt
  wget http://downloads.sf.net/project/spacefm/spacefm-x.x.x.tar.xz
  wget http://downloads.sf.net/project/spacefm/spacefm-x.x.x-installer.sh
  wget http://downloads.sf.net/project/spacefm/spacefm_x.x.x-1_i386.deb
  wget http://downloads.sf.net/project/spacefm/spacefm_x.x.x-1_amd64.deb
  wget http://downloads.sf.net/project/spacefm/spacefm-hal_x.x.x-1_i386.deb
  wget http://downloads.sf.net/project/spacefm/spacefm-hal_x.x.x-1_amd64.deb


3) Check signature on the SHA256 file:

  gpg --verify spacefm-x.x.x.SHA256.txt

  This should report a good signature like this:  
    gpg: Signature made <SIGNATURE DATE> using DSA key ID 01937621
    gpg: Good signature from IgnorantGuru (igurublog.wordpress.com)
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.

  If "BAD signature" or an unrecognized signature is reported, DO NOT USE the
  downloaded files.  A "key is not certified" warning (shown above) can be
  safely ignored if you visually verified the key fingerprint in step 1.


4) Authenticate the downloaded files:

  sha256sum --check spacefm-x.x.x.SHA256.txt
  
  This should report OK for all the files present.  For example:
  
    spacefm-x.x.x.tar.xz: OK

  If you see FAILED next to a file, then the file is invalid or missing - do
  not use it.
